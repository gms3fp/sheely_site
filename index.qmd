### Hello,

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Politics](https://politics.virginia.edu/) studying American politics at who the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/). My dissertation research is supervised by [Justin H. Kirkland](https://jhkirkla.com/) and focuses on the causes and consequence of state election legislation. Prior to studying at UVA, I earned a B.A. in politics with a minor in philosophy from the University of Washington.

My broader research interests include legislative behavior, race and ethnic politics, and research methods. I also work on state and nation-wide polling projects associated with the [Karsh Institute of Democracy](https://karshinstitute.virginia.edu/) and the [Virginia Department of Elections](https://www.elections.virginia.gov/) regarding voting experiences and perceptions of democratic legitimacy.
