    "text": "Hello,\nI am the Research Director for the Voting Laws Roundup project at the Democracy Policy Lab in UC Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy in partnership with the Brennan Center for Justice.\nI studied for my PhD at the University of Virginia. My dissertation research was supervised by Justin H. Kirkland and focuses on the causes and consequences of state election legislation. Prior to studying at UVA, I earned a B.A. in politics with a minor in philosophy from the University of Washington.\nMy broader research interests include legislative behavior, race and ethnic politics, and research methods. I have also previously worked on state and nation-wide polling projects associated with the Karsh Institute of Democracy and the Virginia Department of Elections regarding voting experiences and perceptions of democratic legitimacy."
